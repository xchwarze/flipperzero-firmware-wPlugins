# MicroPython

[MicroPython](https://micropython.org/) is a version of the popular [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language, especially tailored for the hardware requirements of small microcontrollers, like the Flipper Zero.
Instead of supporting the full standard library, only a subset is implemented, carefully selected with the requirements of a microcontroller environment in mind.
But this should not limit your creativity and ability to create great applications at all.

## API

Coming soon - checkout the [examples](https://github.com/ofabel/mp-flipper/tree/master/examples) for now.

## Disclaimer

Running MicroPython is a heavy task for the Flipper.
This does sometimes lead to an _Out of Memory_ error.
**This doesn't harm your Flipper.**
